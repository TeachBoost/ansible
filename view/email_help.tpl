    Greetings {{user.name}}!
<p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    Welcome to the TeachBoost Ansible! This tool will help you keep the rest of
    the team up to date on what you've been working on.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    To use Ansible, send an email to Ansible with a list of each task you've completed.
    Each task should be separated by a blank line in the body of your email.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 5px 0;">
    When you send tasks to Ansible, it will record the date you completed the task.
    By default Ansible will use the date it receives your email, but if you want to
    report tasks from a day in the past, put the date in the subject of the email:
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 25px; color: #333;">
    - "6/12", "Jun 12", "June 12"<br />
    - You can also use "yesterday" or "X days ago" where X is an integer<br />
    - Support for future tasks was going to have not been added... yet.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">

    You may also see all of your subscriptions by sending an email with <strong>subscriptions</strong>
    in the subject line.

    In service,
