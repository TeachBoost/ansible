    Greetings {{user.name}}
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    Ansible hasn't heard from you at all today so we're just checking
    in to see if there's anything you've done recently that you'd like
    to share with the rest of the team.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    You can report tasks by emailing Ansible with a list of each task
    you've completed. Each task should be separated by a blank line
    in the body of your email.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    You can always manage your settings, including whether you'd like
    to continue receiving these reminder emails, by visiting
    <a href="{{_public_url}}">Ansible</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In service,
    <br />
