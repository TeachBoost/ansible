    Greetings {{user.name}}!
<p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
    Welcome to the TeachBoost Ansible!<br />
    This tool will help you keep the rest of the team up to date on what you've been working on.
    To use Ansible, send an email to Ansible with a list of each task you've completed
    (each task should be on a separate line).<br />
    When you send tasks to Ansible, it will record the date you completed the task. By default
    Ansible will use the date it receives your email, but if you want to report tasks from a day
    in the past, put the date in the subject of the email.<br />
    Ex. "6/12", "Jun 12", "June 12". You can also use "yesterday" or "X days ago" where X is an integer.<br />
    Support for future tasks was going to have not been added... yet.
</p>

<p>
    You can manage your notification
    preferences by emailing Ansible and following these guidelines:
</p>
<ol style="margin: 0 0 20px 0;">
    <li>
        The email must have the word 'manage' in the subject line
    </li>
    <li>
        All commands go on a separate line
    </li>
</ol>

        Set's the email notification time for a specific day. The time needs
